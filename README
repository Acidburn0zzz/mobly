This package includes Mobly, a test framework that specializes in supporting
test cases that require complex environment and/or hardware setups.

The test logic runs on a host machine and controls a collection of components
in a test bed. A component can be a device, a piece of equipment, a cloud
service, or anything else needed for a test.

The Mobly pakcage also comes with a set of useful controller libraries to get
you started, like the controller lib for Android devices.
